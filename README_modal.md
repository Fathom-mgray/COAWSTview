# Welcome to FathomCast by [Fathom Science](https://fathomscience.com)!

## What is FathomCast?

FathomCast is Fathom Science's web-based application for exploring high-resolution atmospheric and oceanic model results and observations. We compile publically available data (see *Data Sources* below) with our proprietary high-resolution (7.5km gridspacing) model forecast data to deliver interactive visualizations fit for everyone from scientists to the general public! 

## Why should I use Fathomcast?

FathomCast isn't just another a weather-radar app for the ocean- at Fathom Science, we want you to *explore* the data we are presenting. Sure, you can see the current and future ocean conditions, but what if you want to see what's happening- quite literally -under the surface? What if you want to compare the speed of the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico with the temperature of the surrounding water? All that and more is not only possible, but very easy to do with FathomCast. FathomCast has another unique attribute: we give you the data you ask for. As you zoom in, zoom out, pan around the world, explore the depths and the future, we are constantly performing calculations and pulling the data you want. Dynamically displaying data costs a couple seconds, but once the plots are loaded you have a lot of freedom in exploring.  

## How do I use FathomCast?

To get started, we pulled our latest forecast data for the Gulf of Mexico and plotted four variables of interest for you: 10-meter high winds (top-left), significant wave height (top-right), currents (bottom-left) and water temperature (bottom-right, with contours of sea-level). On the left of the screen there are a couple of controls to change the depth and timestep you are viewing. When you make a selection in one of these menus, your data is grabbed, transformed, and displayed in a couple seconds, then you are free to pan around, zoom in and out, hover over values, with no-delay! As you zoom in and out, we resample the data and rescale the colorbars so you are always looking at plots that look like htey were made for what you are currently viewing. 

## A word of caution

FathomCast is our newest online product- it still has a few kinks to iron out. The vast majority of problems can be solved by refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, selecting a new timestep or variable should restart all the plots. Please give us any feedback related to bugs you discover by emailing <mgray@fathomscience.com>!
